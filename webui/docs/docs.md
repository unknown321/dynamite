### Requirements

- OS:
    - Windows 10 or later
    - Linux kernel 3.2 or later / Steam OS
- Legitimate and unmodified Steam copy of the game (JP version is not supported)
- Connection to Steam network
- At least 1GB free space on system partition and game location drive
- A friend to play with

It is also heavily recommended to have 100% save to access all working missions.

If you are seeing this text in your browser after launching the mod executable, your OS is supported.

Non-Steam versions are not supported for variety of reasons not mentioned here.

To restore your game files and remove previously installed mods right-click on the game in your Library and
choose `Properties`; then go to the `Local Files` tab and click on `Verify integrity of game cacheâ€¦`.

Connection to Steam network is required to create initial connection between host and client. Co-op won't work during
Steam weekly maintenance period. If there is no connection to Steam, you can check
<a href="https://steamstat.us/" target="_blank">Unofficial Steam Status website</a>.

---

### Configuration

#### Co-op

Check `Host mode` to host the co-op session. See [Playing](#Playing) section for differences between hosting and
joining as a client.

Otherwise, paste your host's Steam profile url to `Host Steam ID`. You can get it from Steam client by navigating to
host's Steam profile, right-clicking the page and selecting `Copy Page URL`.

As a host, add unwanted persons to `Blacklist` or limit your co-op session to a close circle of friends
by adding them to `Whitelist`. If whitelist has entries in it, blacklist is ignored.

#### dynamite

Before installation dynamite creates backup of your save files in a zip file, creates a copy of them and uses that copy.
For that, `Account Directory` is used. If there is only one account on your PC and Steam is installed in usual location,
this field will be filled automatically.

If you need to change `Web UI address/port` to avoid port conflicts/listening interface, change the corresponding field.

`Master Key` is the key that will be used in combination with other keys during gameplay to invoke various dynamite
features. Default value is `V` (`ZOOM_CHANGE`).

`Reload Key` is the key to reload configuration and loaded lua scripts in game. Hold `Master Key` and `Reload Key`
for a second together; in case of success `Keys bound` will be printed in game log. Default value is `E` (`ACTION`).

Check `Skip Web UI on start` if you are fine with current settings; on the next launch Web UI won't open in browser,
no installation will be performed, you can start the game right after launching dynamite executable.

---

#### Master server

Master server holds records about your online resources; game requires working connection to it to play co-op.
Usually, after a mission some data is sent to original master server, including your records. Co-op sessions differ
from regular single-player missions in variety of ways; wrong or broken data might be sent to the server. Wrong data
*may*
result in online ban from original server. To protect your account, dynamite comes with bundled master server
implementation <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/fuse" target="_blank">fuse</a>, which runs locally.

`Use Local Master Server` will start a local server on port 6667. If you want to connect to another public master server
instance (**not recommended**), uncheck it and enter address in the `URL` field.

---

#### Key bindings

You can add and change key combinations to run dynamite functions (see [Playing](#Playing)) or external lua scripts.

To use them, hold `Master Key` for a second and press key from the table to call corresponding function in game.

`Dynamite.CreateClientSession` entry is required to connect to the host;
`Dynamite.ResetClientSessionStateWithNotification` is required to reset session state in case of connection issues. You
should keep these entries; feel free to change default keys (`UP` and `LEFT` arrow buttons).

---

#### Miscellaneous

To indicate that function was executed, game will play a clicking sound. Uncheck `Play sound on function call` to
disable it.

---

### Installing

1. Right-click the game in the Steam library and choose `Properties`, then go to the `Local files` tab and
   click `Browse local files`
2. Put dynamite executable into the game directory
3. Launch dynamite executable
4. Browser window will open
5. Linux / SteamOS only: you must set custom launch options before starting the game: Steam --> MGSV:TPP
   --> Game properties --> Set Launch Options: `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8.dll=n,b" %command%`

Fill in required fields in `Configuration` tab, press `Save configuration`. Your config and game files will be updated.
You can track installation status in console window or wait for the information on status page. After installation
keep console window open - master server is running in there.

---

### Updating

Download latest release from <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/dynamite/releases/latest" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
and launch the executable. This mod is **not** available on Nexus Mods or Discord and distributed only through GitHub.

---

### Playing

**Note**: dynamite uses its own save files, which are a copy of yours. However, online resources and funds are **not**
transferred to local master server; stub data is used instead.

**Note**: various online features (such as FOB missions, PF rankings) are not working at the moment.

Playing with others **requires** some sort of communication, be it text or voice (Steam Chat provides both).

Steps:

1. Agree on roles (host/client)
2. Configure dynamite
3. Launch the game
4. Choose working mission from <a href="/missionlist>list</a> and tell it to your partner

---

#### Mission list

Click <a href="/missionlist">here</a> for full mission list.

---

#### Host

Start the mission as usual. When you see your character (past mission splash screen), tell your partner to connect. Wait
for partner at the landing zone.

**Warning**: By default (empty blacklist/whitelist), anyone can join your session if they know your SteamID and the fact
that you
are in mission. After establishing connection clients know your IP address. Use black/whitelists accordingly.

---

#### Client

**IMPORTANT STEP**: Wait for host to load the mission, then press `Master Key` + `UP` arrow to connect
(`Dynamite.CreateClientSession` key bind). It must be done every time by client before starting the mission.

Read the notifications in the game log; if the connection fails, try again. After `Connection established` message start
the same mission. If you are getting "You have been disconnected" popup, press `Master Key` + `LEFT` arrow to reset
session state and try again.

An indication of success is broken camera in the intro sequence - it will fly around host's position instead of yours.

After that play the game.

**Notes:**

- Due to various issues (see below) players respawn 10 seconds after death instead of failing the mission
- To finish the mission, at least one player must exfiltrate the hot zone
- Fultoning other players results in mission failure
- Restarting mission from pause menu results in infinite loading
- Host may have to wait up to 30 seconds to reach the results menu

---

### Issues

You can (and will) experience various issues such as:

- crashes on triggering mission triggers
- invisible players
- invisible hostages
- players not respawning after death
- broken animations
- wrong reticle color (green on enemies)
- enemies unexpectedly switching targets
- teleporting enemies
- support vehicle desynchronization
- D-Horse desynchronization
- missing mission targets (soldiers, vehicles etc.)
- broken mission scripts preventing you from finishing the mission
- everything else

You can report these on <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/dynamite/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (recommended)
or ask for help in <a href="https://discord.gg/3XwAsWV" target="_blank">Modders' Heaven Discord</a>.

---

#### Mission not loading

If you've selected a broken mission, it may never load. Close the game, select another mission from the list.

---

#### Providing crash info

Important information:

- mission id/name
- your role (host/client)
- what did you do (shot tree with non-lethal gun)
- where did you do it (at x.y.z, iDroid screenshot fully zoomed out)
- video if possible (Steam Recording / NVIDIA ShadowPlay)

You can also collect a crash dump on Windows by following
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wer/collecting-user-mode-dumps" target="_blank">this guide</a>.
Set dump type to `Mini dump` (1).

---

### Uninstalling

To restore your game files right-click on the game in your Library and
choose `Properties`; then go to the `Local Files` tab and click on `Verify integrity of game cacheâ€¦`.

Remove manually from game directory:

- dynamite executable
- dynamite directory
- `dinput8.dll`

After that game will use your regular saves.

---

### Restoring or replacing dynamite save files

1. Disable Steam Cloud sync for TPP and GZ (yes, both of them).
2. Turn off Steam.
3. Navigate to:

```
    <Steam-folder>\userdata\<user-id>\287700\local\
    <Steam-folder>\userdata\<user-id>\311340\remote\
```

4. Delete all files named `DYNAMITE_*` in both directories (and keep everything else).
5. Start Steam
6. Remove dynamite directory from game directory
7. Reinstall dynamite
8. Start the game, let it save somewhere, close the game
9. Enable Steam cloud sync, select "local" when cloud warning pops up.

---

### Executing custom lua code (info for modders)

Create `example.lua` in `<game directory>/lua` directory. Contents:

```lua
local example = {}

function example.test()
    TppUiCommand.AnnounceLogView('IsSessionConnect: ' .. tostring(TppNetworkUtil.IsSessionConnect()))
end

return example
```

Now you can bind `test` function to a key combination using web UI. Put `example` as module and `test` as a function.
Code is dynamically reloaded on `Master Key` + `Reload Key` press (`V + E` by default).
